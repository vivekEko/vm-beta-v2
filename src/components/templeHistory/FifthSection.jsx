          Vanamamalai mutt is an ancient srivaishnava mutt which was established
          by ponnadikkal jiyar under the orders of manavala mamunigal.
          Ponnadikkal jiyar was the first and foremost disciple and this mutt is
          one of the most important mutts of srivaishnava sath sampradhayam.
          <br />
          <br />A mutt is a spiritual center where ancient knowledge strives and
          blossoms through regular discourses and education by learned scholars.
          Srivaishnava mutts are generally headed by sannyasis and are run under
          the authority of them. Srivaishnava sannyasis are generally identified
          as ubhaya vedhanthacharyas and paramahamsa parivrajaka acharyas.
          Ubhaya vedhanthacharya means one who has mastered both samskritha
          vedham and dhravida vedham with their in-depth meanings. Paramahamsa
          means one who is like a swan which is pure and the one which can
          distinguish between saram (essence) and asaram (residue/insignficant).
          Parivrajaka means one who is a mendicant - travelling preacher. Though
          sannyasis do not stay in the same place continuously, for the welfare
          of all beings, srivaishnava sannyasis, out of great compassion, stay
          in a mutt as allowed in sasthram and elaborate on spiritual principles
